autonomously until everything — including work it discovers along the way — is done.

It's deliberately generic. [The workflow spec](/projektor/agents/workflow-spec/) is the
projektor-specific half — definition of ready, the status state machine, human review
gates, fleet coordination rules. This playbook is the shape of the *run* that drives
those rules, so an agent working an epic normally fetches both.

## Getting the directive

\`get_playbook("epic-goal")\` returns this page verbatim, template and all — read it and
adapt it by hand.

\`compose_playbook("epic-goal", { epicRef, variant, reviewModel, cadence, checkpointInterval })\`
returns just the directive, with every placeholder already filled from data the server holds:

| Parameter / source | Fills |
|---|---|
| \`epicRef\` *(required)* — resolved to the epic's ref and title | the **Goal** clause |
| \`variant\` — \`bounded\` (default) or \`full\` | the **Self-feed** and **Done when** clauses |
| \`cadence\` (default 2) and \`reviewModel\` (default \`opus\`) | the **Review cadence** clause |
| \`checkpointInterval\` (default 10) | the **Human checkpoint** clause |
| the epic's open child count and the project's agent WIP limit | an extra **Live data** clause |

MCP clients that support the \`prompts\` primitive surface the same composed directive as a
slash command, with the four optional parameters as prompt arguments.

## What each clause is for

- **Goal** — a concrete entry point (an epic ref, not a prose description) plus an explicit
  autonomy grant. Without the grant a run tends to stop after the first ticket to ask
  what's next.
- **Audit first** — on a resumed run, an agent that doesn't look first repeats work that
  is already merged to origin/main or sitting in an open PR. This is also the clause that
  matters most after a context compaction, when the agent's memory of the run is gone but
  the directive isn't.
- **Loop** — \`get_prioritized_issues\` chooses the next ticket rather than the agent, so
  ordering follows the project's own priority and blocked-by rules.
- **Self-feed** — filing discovered bugs and follow-ons back onto the epic turns it into a
  generator rather than a fixed list. This is the only clause the two variants differ on.
- **Review cadence** — naming the model and the interval up front makes the checkpoint
  something the agent can self-enforce; "review as you go" doesn't survive a long run.
- **Human checkpoint** — a diff review and a green build catch neither a regression that
  only shows up when a page actually loads, nor a decision that was wrong on the merits.
  Naming a URL, a script, and the one thing the agent is least sure about gives a human
  something to act on instead of a queue of PR titles.
- **Done when** — a checkable condition (every ticket closed, verification green,
  everything pushed) instead of a judgment call.
- **Decisions log** — most judgment calls land as comments on the epic for review at the
  end, so an ambiguity doesn't block the run on a question. The exception is a decision
  that's cheap to reverse now and expensive later, which is surfaced immediately instead —
  logging it only at the end would let several more tickets compound a call nobody has
  actually agreed with yet.

## Template — bounded variant (default)

> ${EPIC_GOAL_TEMPLATE.goal}
>
> ${EPIC_GOAL_TEMPLATE.auditFirst}
>
> ${EPIC_GOAL_TEMPLATE.loop}
>
> ${EPIC_GOAL_TEMPLATE.selfFeed.bounded}
>
> ${EPIC_GOAL_TEMPLATE.reviewCadence}
>
> ${EPIC_GOAL_TEMPLATE.humanCheckpoint}
>
> ${EPIC_GOAL_TEMPLATE.doneWhen.bounded}
>
> ${EPIC_GOAL_TEMPLATE.decisionsLog}

## Template — full variant

Same as bounded, with the self-feed clause replaced by:

> ${EPIC_GOAL_TEMPLATE.selfFeed.full}

And "done when" covers original + generated tickets.

## Choosing a variant

| Situation | Variant |
|---|---|
| Epic has a crisp outcome; scope creep is the risk | bounded |
| Exploratory/quality epic where the discovered work *is* the point | full |

Full-variant runs can generate more tickets than the epic started with; if that happens
mid-run, switch to bounded and park the tail.

## Fleet and multi-agent use

For epics too large for one session, the same directive works as a worker prompt: post it
as a comment on the epic and give each worker the ticket URL as its entry point. Nobody
hands out the tickets: each worker takes its own through \`claim_issue\`, and the lease
keeps the others off it. That is why the composed directive reports the project's agent
WIP limit, the cap on how many tickets one worker may hold at a time.

Workers that share one credential (one token for the whole fleet) must pass the \`agentId\`
from \`register_agent\` to \`claim_issue\`, \`heartbeat_agent\` and \`end_agent\`. A lone agent on its
own credential may omit it.

It's deliberately domain-agnostic: the steps below have been run on maritime data
businesses, but nothing in them is maritime-specific.

## Getting the directive

\`get_playbook("idea-discovery")\` returns this page verbatim — read it and adapt it by
hand, filling in the domain description.

## Input

A one-paragraph description of the domain or application area to explore.

## Constraints applied throughout

- **Free/open data sources only** — verify licences permit commercial reuse before relying
  on a source. A promising idea built on a data source you can't legally use commercially
  is not a promising idea.
- **Every idea needs a clear distribution channel** — a press cycle, SEO, an existing
  community, or a developer channel. An idea with no plausible way to reach users is not
  worth qualifying further, however novel.
- **Solo technical founder** — favour products buildable as an app or API on serverless
  infrastructure. Ideas that need a team, capital, or bespoke infra to stand up don't fit
  the constraint and should be discarded early, not qualified.

## Steps

Web search at every stage. Pause for a decision at each transition — don't run straight
through to idea generation without confirming the frontier, assets, and landscape are
right.

1. **Research frontier** — recent advances (roughly the last 3 years) in the domain's
   literature. Skip this step entirely if the domain isn't research-driven.
2. **Assets** — open datasets, records, feeds, and registries available in the domain;
   their licences; what can be inferred from them beyond their stated purpose.
3. **Landscape** — incumbents in tiers (raw data providers → enterprise intelligence →
   vertical tools), with pricing. Note who is served at what price point, and who isn't
   served at all.
4. **Gap hypotheses** — propose gaps between what the landscape serves and what the
   assets/frontier make possible, then actively try to falsify each one with further
   searches. Report kills explicitly — a dead hypothesis is progress, not a wasted step.
5. **Idea generation** — batches of roughly 10 ideas. Each idea gets exactly three
   attributes: novelty, free data source(s) it relies on, and its distribution channel.
   No idea without all three.
6. **Qualification** — for ideas on the shortlist: product shape, user story, similar
   existing products, and the unserved niche it targets. Then pressure-test the
   load-bearing assumption — usually licensing, legal exposure, or moat — the one
   assumption that kills the idea if it's wrong.
7. **Sequencing** — a build order that exploits shared infrastructure across ideas (a
   dataset pipeline or API client one idea needs is often reusable by the next). Name the
   cheapest first experiment explicitly.

## Principles

- **Cheap evidence before commitment** — a falsifying search costs minutes; a shipped
  product costs weeks. Spend the cheap evidence first.
- **Be honest when a space is saturated** — a landscape step that finds five well-funded
  incumbents at every price tier is a valid, useful outcome. Don't force a gap that isn't
  there.
- **Desk validation is not buyer validation** — qualification and sequencing narrow the
  field on desk research alone. They are not a substitute for talking to a real buyer
  before building.
