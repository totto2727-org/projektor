# Contributing

projektor is a personal project, built and maintained by one person (with AI
agents). It's open source under the [MIT licence](./LICENSE) - fork it, deploy
it, modify it, learn from it.

## Issues and pull requests

**Pull requests, issues, and feature requests are all welcome.** projektor is
maintained by one person (with AI agents), so review happens on their own
schedule rather than a fixed SLA - but everything is read and considered.

For security issues, follow [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) (report privately, not
via a public issue).

## Working in the code

If you're modifying a fork, [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) is the source of truth for
conventions: file layout, the service-layer contract (REST and MCP must stay at
parity), and how to work in parallel without conflicts. Read it before changing
anything.

Both checks must be green (CI runs a fuller set - see [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)):

```bash
pnpm --filter @projektor/api test   # vitest against an in-process Worker + Miniflare D1
pnpm exec turbo type-check               # tsc --noEmit across the monorepo
```
