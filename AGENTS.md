Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working **on** the projektor codebase.

## What projektor is

A project management tool deployed on Cloudflare, combining AI-native design with tried-and-tested principles.

Design principles

1. Fast and lightweight.
2. Serverless, built on Cloudflare resources.

Implementation details:

- When implementing a feature or fixing a bug, always add a test that confirms the behaviour.
- **Runtime:** Hono on Cloudflare Workers
- **Data:** D1 (SQLite) for relational data, KV for caching (Access certs, user-by-email), R2 for file attachments
- **Schema:** Drizzle is the schema and primary query layer; raw `DB.prepare` remains in the auth/workspace middleware hot path, the dev bootstrap, and a handful of service queries (FTS, counters) where hand-written SQL is clearer.
- **Monorepo:** Bun workspaces + turbo. `apps/api` (the Worker), `apps/web` (Astro + Preact static site, served in production via CF Workers Static Assets — see below), `apps/docs` (the Astro docs site linked throughout this file), `packages/*` (db, types, plugin-sdk), `plugins/*`
- **Deploy:** projektor publishes a self-contained **release artifact** on each `v*` tag; a config-only deploy repo (e.g. `projektor-deploy-example`) downloads it and ships it with `wrangler` — no submodule, no source checkout downstream. The Worker (`apps/api`) and the built frontend (`apps/web/dist`) ship together: `wrangler.toml` declares an `[assets]` binding with `run_worker_first = ["/api/*", "/mcp/*", "/wiki", "/.well-known/*"]`, so those paths always hit the Hono Worker while every other path serves the static Astro output (per-route HTML, asset-first). The release build compiles `apps/web` and bundles the Worker into a single `worker.js`.

## Coordination model (read this first)

Projektor expects multiple agents to work the same workspace concurrently. Before
editing anything:

- **Claim before editing.** File claims (`claim_files`) are path-level — they stop two
  agents editing the same files. Matching is **exact string equality**, not globs:
  claiming `src/` reserves nothing under `src/`, so name concrete paths and name them the
  same way the rest of the fleet does. Issue leases (`claim_issue`) are work-item-level —
  they stop two agents picking up the same ticket. The two are independent; you need both.
- **Your session goes stale if you stop heartbeating.** Liveness is heartbeat-based:
  `ACTIVE_TTL` in `apps/api/src/services/agents.ts` (mirrored as `SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` in
  `apps/api/src/services/issue-leases.ts`) is **120 seconds**. Register, then go quiet for
  two minutes without a `heartbeat_agent` call, and your session goes stale — you must
  heartbeat again before you can claim.
- **Both tiers self-heal.** An issue lease or file claim held by a stale session is
  reclaimed by the next claimer in the same call (`release_reason: "expired"`). Still call
  `release_files` and `end_agent` when you finish: reclaim only happens when someone else
  wants the path, so until then your claims sit there looking held, and a clean exit is
  what distinguishes you from a crash in the health data. A claim with no `agent_id` has no
  heartbeat to judge and is never auto-reclaimed — `force` is the only way past it.
- **There's a per-project cap on concurrently leased issues** —
  `DEFAULT_AGENT_WIP_LIMIT = 3` in `apps/api/src/services/issue-leases.ts`,
  overridable per project via `projects.agent_wip_limit`. It's admission control on
  the backlog, not a rate limit: it bounds how much work can be in flight at once,
  not how fast you can ask.
- **A refused claim tells you who to talk to.** Rejection is all-or-nothing: nothing is
  claimed, and the error names the issue and agent holding the path — message them with
  `post_message` if you need it. Nothing is pushed to the holder on a plain rejection —
  its claim didn't change. `force` is different: it posts to both your issue scope (audit)
  and theirs (PROJ-635), since you just took something they thought they still held. Every
  contended path is recorded regardless.

This is the mechanism; the mechanical call sequence for this repo is under "Fleet
coordination protocol" below, and the design rationale (why leases, claims, and the
WIP cap are shaped this way) is the [coordination model](https://tajd.github.io/projektor/philosophy/coordination-model/)
doc. The workflow rules themselves (definition of ready, state machine, human review
gates) live in exactly one place, the [workflow spec](https://tajd.github.io/projektor/agents/workflow-spec/)
— call `get_workflow` before claiming work; they aren't restated here.

## Planning and design docs live in the wiki, not the repo

Design records, implementation plans, and specs belong in the projektor wiki (`create_wiki_page`/`update_wiki_page`), not in a repo `docs/` folder. Keeping them in the wiki makes them discoverable and searchable (`search_wiki`) instead of buried in git history. Root-level user-facing docs (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`) are the only docs that belong in the repo itself.

## Human-authored files

Most docs may be generated or written by agents, but these paths are human-authored (Tom's decision, PROJ-915):

- `README.md`
- `apps/docs/src/content/docs/philosophy/**`

Agents must not edit these files, not even to fix a typo or a stale fact. When your work makes one of them inaccurate, add a comment to the current editorial issue (PROJ-914 or its successor) that quotes the affected line and states the fact that changed. Docs checks may still scan these files and report drift, but the fix goes to the editorial issue, never into an agent's diff. `.github/CODEOWNERS` requires @TAJD's review on both paths.

## Architecture: the service-layer contract (most important)

There are **two surfaces** over the same data — a REST API and an MCP (JSON-RPC) server.
They MUST behave identically. The mechanism that guarantees this:

```
routes/<domain>.ts   (REST wrapper)  ─┐
                                       ├─►  services/<domain>.ts   ─►  D1
mcp/<domain>.ts      (MCP wrapper)   ─┘     (ALL business logic + SQL live here)
```

**Rules:**
1. **All business logic and SQL live in `services/<domain>.ts`.** Routes and MCP tools are thin wrappers — resolve context, call the service, adapt the result/error. No SQL in `routes/` or `mcp/`.
2. **REST and MCP must stay at parity.** If you add or change behavior, do it in the service so *both* surfaces get it. Adding a feature to only one surface is a bug.
3. **Validation happens inside the service** via a shared Zod schema in `schemas/<domain>.ts` — so REST and MCP are validated identically. Never trust raw `unknown` input in a wrapper.
4. **Services throw typed errors** from `services/errors.ts` (`ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `ForbiddenError`, `ConflictError`). The wrappers translate them:
   - REST: `http/error-adapter.ts` → HTTP status (400/404/403/409)
   - MCP: `mcp/error-adapter.ts` → a tool result with `isError: true` and `{error: {code, message, fields?, hint?, details?}}` (PROJ-893; `code` is the service error kind). JSON-RPC `error` is only for protocol faults and unexpected internal errors. Never return raw `String(err)` to clients.
5. **Context** is a `ServiceCtx` (`services/types.ts`): `{ db, kv, r2, workspaceId, userId, role? }`. Build it with `ctxFromHono(c)` in REST; the MCP dispatch (`routes/mcp.ts`) builds the equivalent and passes `role` through `PluginContext`.

### Deliberate REST↔MCP parity exceptions

These surface-only features are intentional, not drift — don't re-flag them in future
audits:

- **File attachment upload/download (`POST /api/files`, `GET /api/files/:id`)** —
  REST-only. Binary/multipart upload and streamed download can't cross JSON-RPC.
  Metadata operations (list, get metadata, link-create, delete) have full MCP parity
  via `mcp/files.ts`.
- **Auth (`routes/auth.ts`): login redirect, API token minting/revocation** — REST-only.
  CF Access login is a browser redirect flow; token minting/revocation is a sensitive
  credential operation kept off the MCP surface.
- **Workspace-scoped API tokens (`POST/GET/DELETE /api/workspaces/:slug/tokens`)** —
  REST-only, same rationale as auth tokens above.
- **`GET /api/workspaces/:slug/mcp-info`** — REST-only. Bootstraps how to connect an MCP
  client in the first place; inherently can't be an MCP tool.
- **Cross-workspace project list (`GET /api/projects` → `listAllProjects`)** — REST-only.
  MCP connections are bound to a single workspace (`/mcp/<workspaceId>`), so a
  cross-workspace listing doesn't fit the MCP connection model. MCP's `list_projects` is
  the single-workspace equivalent (different, plainer shape — no `open_issue_count` /
  `workspace_name` rollups).
- **Public issue sharing (`POST /api/issues/:id/share`, `GET /api/share/:token`)** —
  REST-only. Share-link creation/redemption is a browser-facing feature (the redemption
  endpoint is intentionally unauthenticated by token).
- **`get_prioritized_issues`** — MCP-only. An agent-productivity tool ("what should I
  work on next") with no natural REST/browser analog.
- **Wiki export (`GET /api/wiki/export`)** — REST-only. Returns a binary zip
  (markdown + attachments) which can't cross JSON-RPC the same way file download
  can't (see the file-attachment exception above); import is explicitly out of
  scope (PROJ-497) so there's no round-trip MCP surface to keep parity with either.
- **Public feedback submission (`POST /api/feedback/submit`)** — REST-only.
  Anonymous end-user feedback from a third-party product, authenticated by a per-source
  bearer token, not a session — there's no ServiceCtx user/role for an MCP tool to act as.
  Feedback *source management* (create/list/update/rotate/revoke) and authenticated
  *read/triage* (`list_feedback`, `update_feedback_status`, `convert_feedback_to_issue`)
  both have full REST+MCP parity, same as every other domain; only the anonymous submit
  endpoint itself is the exception (PROJ-668).
- **OAuth consent (`GET/POST /oauth/authorize`, `services/oauth.ts`)** — REST-only, and
  browser-only. The whole point of the consent screen is that a *human* decides which
  client may act as them; an agent is the subject of a grant, never the party that
  approves one. `middleware/auth.ts` fails the route closed for API tokens and for the
  shared PUBLIC_READ_ONLY viewer for the same reason. `/oauth/token` is not a projektor
  route at all — the OAuth library serves it before Hono sees the request.
- **Connector grants (`GET/DELETE /api/workspaces/:slug/connectors`)** — REST-only, for
  the same reason token minting is: withdrawing a credential is a sensitive operation, and
  a connector should not be able to enumerate or revoke credentials — least of all its
  own siblings. The list is scoped to the requesting user, not the workspace: a grant is a
  personal credential, so unlike `pk_` tokens no admin can see or revoke someone else's.

### The security invariant: always scope by workspace
Every query MUST be scoped by `workspace_id` (directly, or via a parent entity that was itself workspace-checked — e.g. comments verify their issue belongs to the workspace first). A missing scope is a cross-tenant data leak. This is the single most important correctness rule in the codebase.

### The D1 limit: never bind a row-scaled array into one query
Cloudflare **D1 rejects any query with more than 100 bound parameters.** A query whose parameter count grows with an input array — drizzle `inArray`, a raw `IN (...)`, or a batched mutation keyed by ids — will throw at runtime (a 500) once the array is large enough. **This is invisible in tests:** the vitest runner backs D1 with SQLite (cap 32766), so an un-chunked query passes CI and only fails on real D1.

Route every variable-length `IN`/`inArray` load through **`inChunks` (`services/sql.ts`)**, which splits the array so each query stays under the cap:

```ts
const rows = await inChunks(issueIds, (chunk) =>
  orm.select(...).from(...).where(and(inArray(table.id, chunk), eq(table.workspaceId, ctx.workspaceId)))
);
// for a mutation that returns nothing, have the callback return []
```

Bounded arrays (enums like priority) are fine to bind directly. When in doubt, chunk.

## Versioning

**`apps/web/package.json` is the single version source** for the whole monorepo -
bumped by `release-prepare.yml`, tagged by `release-tag.yml`, and read by
`release.yml`/`scripts/build-release.sh` to produce the release artifact (embedded
as `VERSION` in the tarball and injected into the MCP `serverInfo.version` via
esbuild `--define`). Every other `apps/*`/`packages/*` package's `package.json`
`version` field is a fixed `0.0.0-workspace` placeholder — those packages are
workspace-internal and not independently released, so their version field is unused
and intentionally never bumped. `plugins/*` packages carry their own unused
placeholder versions (e.g. `0.0.0`, `0.0.1`), not `0.0.0-workspace`.

## File layout per domain

When adding/changing a domain (issues, projects, wiki, comments, …):

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `apps/api/src/services/<domain>.ts` | business logic, SQL, validation, typed errors |
| `apps/api/src/schemas/<domain>.ts` | Zod schemas (single source of truth; shared primitives in `schemas/common.ts`) |
| `apps/api/src/routes/<domain>.ts` | REST wrapper (mounted in `index.ts`) |
| `apps/api/src/mcp/<domain>.ts` | MCP tool array (composed in `routes/mcp.ts`) |
| `apps/api/src/test/<domain>.test.ts` | **domain tests go here** |

**Test convention (don't skip this):** put a domain's tests in its own `<domain>.test.ts`. Do **not** pile MCP tests into the shared `test/mcp.test.ts` — parallel work on multiple domains will collide there on merge. (`mcp.test.ts` is for cross-cutting dispatch behavior only.)

## Conventions & gotchas

- **Adding a migration?** After adding a new `.sql` file to `packages/db/migrations/`, you must also add a corresponding `?raw` import to `apps/api/src/test/migrations.ts` and append it to the `MIGRATIONS` array. Without this the test DB won't have the new table and integration tests will silently fail or error. Migrations are **hand-written SQL** — drizzle-kit's generator is deliberately not wired up (PROJ-643): its journal was abandoned after `0001`, so `drizzle-kit generate` diffed against a snapshot ~52 migrations stale and emitted a full `CREATE TABLE` for every table, which would fail against any non-empty database. Don't re-add it without re-baselining the snapshot first. A migration that adds an index ends with `PRAGMA optimize;` so the planner has fresh statistics (PROJ-857).
- **Deletes never rely on FK cascades.** Deleting a row that other tables reference must remove (or null) those rows explicitly in the service, in the same `db.batch()` - `ON DELETE CASCADE/SET NULL` in the schema is not the cleanup (PROJ-407/918), and FTS mirrors, R2 objects and non-FK references have no cascade at all. Adding an FK with `ON DELETE` means adding the cleanup and an entry in `apps/api/src/test/architecture/fk-cleanup-allowlist.ts`; `fk-cleanup.node.test.ts` fails otherwise. (`PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF` is a no-op on D1/Miniflare, so tests can't switch cascades off to prove cleanup.)
- **camelCase at the boundary, snake_case in the DB.** Input schemas use `assigneeId`, `parentId`, etc.; the service maps to the `assignee_id` column. Keep both surfaces on the same naming.
- **JSON columns** (`labels`, `scopes`) are stored via `JSON.stringify` and returned as raw JSON strings — callers `JSON.parse` on read. There is no automatic (de)serialization.
- **Timestamps** are unix seconds: `Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)`.
- **IDs** are `crypto.randomUUID()`.
- **Issue numbers** use `COALESCE(MAX(number),0)+1` per project — known race under concurrency (tracked as a follow-up).
- **Auth** (`middleware/auth.ts`): Cloudflare Access JWT (browser) OR `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (agents) OR a dev bypass (`DEV_USER_EMAIL`, non-prod only, and never on `/mcp/` — a remote MCP client learns it must authenticate from the 401 challenge, so answering 200 makes the connector flow unreachable). API tokens are workspace-scoped — don't widen that.
- **Login provisioning** (`services/provisioning.ts`): runs on every CF Access / dev-bypass login (not the token path). Cloudflare Access is the gate; config decides what a user gets inside — `ADMIN_EMAILS` → `owner` (first admin login also creates the `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_SLUG` workspace), everyone else → `AUTO_JOIN_ROLE` (default `none` = invite-only; set it, e.g. `viewer`, to auto-join). Idempotent; safe to run per request.
- **Roles** (`owner`/`admin`/`member`/`viewer`) are enforced in services via `ctx.role`. Mutations generally block `viewer`; destructive ops may require `owner`.
- **Group-based project access** is the authorization model for project-scoped data. Access is **default-deny**: owner/admin see everything, but everyone else sees a project only if one of their **groups** holds a `(project, role)` grant. The effective in-project role is the strongest grant across the user's groups and *replaces* their workspace role inside that project (so a workspace `viewer` with a `member` grant can write there). Enforce it through `services/access.ts`: `visibleProjectPredicate` (an indexed `EXISTS` subquery — filter every project-scoped **list** query with it), `effectiveProjectRole`/`requireProjectAccess` (resolve a single resource; `null` → 404 to hide existence), and `canWriteProject`. Membership is read per-request, so grant/revoke takes effect on the next request with no session state. The `groups` domain (service/routes/mcp) is owner/admin-only CRUD over groups, members, and grants.
- **The plugin system is not wired at runtime yet** (`pluginRegistry` is empty; `enabled_plugins` is unread). Treat `plugins/*` as not-yet-functional until that lands.

## localStorage policy (frontend)

`localStorage` may only store **cosmetic preferences** (theme, view mode, layout choices).
Never store server-side entity references (workspace slug, project ID, user ID) — a deleted
or renamed entity leaves a stale value that will silently cause API 4xx errors.

**Before adding a new `localStorage.setItem` call, ask:**
1. Does a stale value ever reach an API request? If yes → don't store it; derive it from
   props or build-time env instead.
2. Does a missing value crash the UI or produce a non-graceful error? If yes → add a
   safe fallback, not localStorage.

Mark safe usages with a `// safe-ls:` comment explaining why (cosmetic, no API dep,
degrades gracefully). This is the convention established in PR #99.

## Frontend: islands and the API layer

All island↔API calls go through `apps/web/src/utils/api-client.ts`:
- `buildHeaders(workspaceSlug, extra?)` — adds the X-Workspace-Slug header
- `apiFetch<T>(path, opts)` — wraps fetch with headers, credentials, JSON parse, and error throwing

No raw `fetch(` calls in island components. No local `buildHeaders` copies.
This mirrors the backend service-layer contract: routes are thin wrappers; islands are thin callers.

## Frontend: project identity (`apps/web/src/lib/project-context.ts`)

Islands are separate `client:load` roots (each its own Preact tree), so Preact context can't
cross between them. Project identity instead lives in a module-level `@preact/signals` store:
`currentProject`, `projectsList`, `projectError`, `projectReady`. Module state survives Astro's
`ClientRouter` navigations, so whichever island resolves first writes it and every sibling
island, plus the next in-app navigation, reads it without a refetch.

Islands call `ensureProjectResolved(workspaceSlug, urlHint?, matches?)` (or the `useCurrentProject`
hook) instead of parsing `?projectId=`/`?id=` or fetching `/api/projects` themselves. Resolution
persists the resolved id back to the address bar via `history.replaceState` (see
`resolve-project-id.ts`'s `persistProjectId`), so copied URLs stay shareable. This is the only
`@preact/signals` usage in the codebase and the only module-level store pattern for cross-island
state — reach for it, don't invent a second one, before adding a new island that needs project
identity.

The identity param is a boundary concern, not a transport mechanism: links between pages that
stay within the resolved project (`ProjectNav`'s tabs, in-app links to a project's own issues,
wiki pages, etc.) carry no project param at all — the store survives the `ClientRouter`
navigation those `<a>` tags trigger, so the destination resolves instantly with no refetch.
`?projectId=` (the project UUID) is written only where identity actually crosses a boundary: the
cold-start entry point (`ProjectList`'s project cards), a full non-SPA reload
(`window.location.href` assignments, which drop all in-memory state), or an explicit project
switch. `?id=` is reserved for a page's own entity (an issue on `/issues/view`, for example) and
is never used for project identity in newly-written links — the resolver still accepts it (along
with `?project=`) on read, for backward compatibility with existing shared URLs.

## Dev workflow

Use the Bun commands below for this fork.
The protected human-authored `README.md` retains upstream package-manager examples and is not the fork's installation guide.

```bash
bun install
bun x turbo type-check                  # tsc --noEmit across the monorepo
bun run --filter @projektor/api test      # vitest against an in-process Worker + D1

# One-time local secrets so the browser frontend can auth without Cloudflare Access:
cp apps/api/.dev.vars.example apps/api/.dev.vars   # DEV_USER_EMAIL + BOOTSTRAP_SECRET
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env             # PUBLIC_WORKSPACE_SLUG=projektor

bun run dev                               # local dev - API on :8787, web on :4321
# `dev` auto-applies D1 migrations to the local Miniflare DB first (db:migrate:local),
# so /api/* won't 500 with "no such table" on a fresh checkout.
```

`GET /bootstrap` (non-prod only, needs `BOOTSTRAP_SECRET`) seeds a workspace + user + token
+ membership in one shot and prints the `claude mcp add ...` command to connect an agent. Seed it once:

```bash
curl -H "X-Bootstrap-Secret: localdev" http://127.0.0.1:8787/bootstrap
```

Then open **http://localhost:4321** — with `DEV_USER_EMAIL` set, the dev auth bypass logs you in
as that user (a member of the seeded `projektor` workspace), and the islands load real data.

**Before opening a PR:** `bun run lint`, `bun x turbo type-check`, `bun run --filter @projektor/db test`, `bun run --filter @projektor/api test:coverage`, `bun run --filter @projektor/web test:coverage`, `bun run --filter @projektor/web build`, and `bun run --filter @projektor/docs build` must all be green, and `bun run gen:docs` must produce no diff. CI runs these plus the island API and design system convention checks (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## E2E testing (`apps/web/e2e`, Playwright)

Targets a **deployed dev instance** (`E2E_BASE_URL`), not local dev — see `apps/web/e2e/README.md` for the full setup, fixtures, and per-spec breakdown. Not run in CI (no live deployment there); run manually or on a schedule.

Three projects, pick the narrowest one that answers your question:
- `desktop` — default viewport, Chromium.
- `mobile` — 375×812 viewport via Chromium's mobile emulation. Fast, good for layout/CSS regressions.
- `mobile-webkit` — real WebKit engine (`devices["iPhone 13"]`). Reach for this specifically when investigating iOS Safari engine-level behavior that Chromium can't reproduce (visual-viewport/on-screen-keyboard resize events, `position: fixed` under scroll, etc.) — it caught the PROJ-397/PROJ-566 class of mobile-modal bugs. Still not a substitute for a real device: no Safari chrome, no PWA install/Add-to-Home-Screen coverage.

```bash
bun --cwd apps/web x playwright test --project=mobile-webkit
```

## Git hooks (lefthook)

`bun install` runs `prepare`, which calls `lefthook install` and wires one hook:

- **pre-commit** — `bun x turbo type-check` (fast; leverages turbo's cache, near-instant on unchanged packages) and `bun x biome check --changed --no-errors-on-unmatched` (lint, changed files only).

There is deliberately no `pre-push` hook — CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is the authoritative gate before merge (main is PR-protected; direct pushes are rejected), so a local pre-push copy of the same checks was pure redundant overhead. It was also a source of real bugs: under concurrent local load its test step could fail while a backgrounded `git push` still reported exit code 0, masking a rejected push. It was removed for these reasons; don't re-add one without addressing both.

CI runs a superset of the pre-commit checks: the generated-docs freshness check, `bun run lint`, `bun x turbo type-check`, `bun run --filter @projektor/db test`, coverage-enforced test runs for `@projektor/api` and `@projektor/web`, and both the web and docs builds. New contributors get the pre-commit hook automatically after `bun install`. See **Before opening a PR** above for the full local command set to run before pushing.

**Bypass for WIP commits:** pass `--no-verify` (or `-n`) to git:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "wip: …"
```

Agent workers should also use `--no-verify` for intermediate commits; run the full checks (listed under "Before opening a PR" above) before opening a PR.

## Fleet coordination protocol

The workflow rules (definition of ready, state machine, human review gates, WIP
limits) have exactly one home: the [workflow spec](https://tajd.github.io/projektor/agents/workflow-spec/),
served live via the `get_workflow` MCP tool / `GET /api/workflow`. Call it before
claiming work — don't rely on a copy of the rules here, they aren't restated in this
file.

What *is* repo-specific and stays here: the mechanical call sequence agents use to
avoid colliding in this particular repo's git worktree/file layout.

### Session identity (PROJ-894)

`register_agent` (and `start_work`) records the credential the call authenticated with on
the session (`agent_sessions.credential_id` + `auth_method`). A lone agent on its own
credential may then omit the agent id on `claim_issue`, `heartbeat_agent` and `end_agent`.
**Fleets that share one credential (one `pk_` token for every worker) should still pass
`agentId` explicitly**: with several live sessions on the credential an omitted id is
ambiguous and is rejected. No per-connection state exists; the session is looked up from the
credential on every call (PROJ-452 statelessness holds).

### The two-call path (PROJ-929)

`start_work` and `finish_work` collapse the sequence below into two calls:

1. `start_work({ issue, paths, name })` at session start — registers the session, claims
   the issue and files (if given), and posts the start message. All-or-nothing with
   compensating cleanup, not a single atomic write (D1 has no cross-call interactive
   transaction): on any conflict (the same `claim_issue`/`claim_files` errors as before)
   the session is ended and nothing is left claimed. If the process crashes mid-call
   (so that cleanup never runs), the claims it made become reclaimable once the
   session's heartbeat goes stale after the 120s TTL, same as any other stale holder.
   Save the returned `sessionId`.
2. `finish_work({ sessionId, issue, completionReport?, status? })` when done — optionally
   transitions the issue via the same path `update_issue` uses (completion-report rules
   apply unchanged), then releases every claim/lease the session holds and ends it.

`claim_issue`/`claim_files`/`update_issue`/`post_message` calls made with a live agent
session id refresh that session's heartbeat as a side effect, and `finish_work` ends the
session outright, so an explicit `heartbeat_agent` is optional on this path — call it
anyway if a lot of work happens between `start_work` and `finish_work` with no other
agent-scoped call in between.

### The five-call path (still supported)

The primitives above compose from these, which remain available for finer-grained
control (e.g. claiming files separately from the issue, or checking `list_file_claims`
before deciding whether to `force`):

1. `register_agent` at session start, linking the issue you're implementing — save the returned `id`.
2. `claim_files` before touching any file (check `list_file_claims` first; back off, don't `force`).
3. `post_message` to `scope: "issue:<uuid>"` when you start/blocker/finish; `scope: "workspace"` for fleet-wide notices.
4. `heartbeat_agent` every ~60 s (sessions time out after 120 s of silence).
5. `release_files` then `end_agent` when done.

See the [MCP tool catalog](https://tajd.github.io/projektor/agents/tool-catalog/) for each tool's exact input schema.

## Working in parallel (multi-agent)

This repo is built out via parallel workers in separate git worktrees. To avoid conflicts:
- Give each worker a **disjoint file set** (one domain = its 4-5 files above). Domains don't share files *except* read-only shared scaffolding (`services/types.ts`, `services/errors.ts`, `schemas/common.ts`, the adapters) and `routes/mcp.ts`/`index.ts`.
- **Never let two parallel workers edit `routes/mcp.ts`, `index.ts`, or `test/mcp.test.ts`** — serialize those, or assign to exactly one worker.
- Large refactors that touch shared files go in a **foundation phase first** (behavior-preserving), then fan out per-domain.

### Spawn prompt requirement

Workers will not use the coordination primitives unless explicitly told to. Every spawn prompt for a parallel worker **must** include a `## Coordination (required)` section stating the call sequence (either the two-call `start_work`/`finish_work` path or the five-call path) from "Fleet coordination protocol" above.

A full spawn prompt also needs a **Finish** section (what "done" means for the task,
and what to report back) alongside the Coordination section above.

### Fleet planning rules

These are the constraints the fleet skill reads to plan batches. Keep them current when the codebase changes.

**Serialized files** — only one worker at a time, ever:

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `apps/api/src/routes/mcp.ts` | MCP tool registry — all domains compose here |
| `apps/api/src/index.ts` | Hono app root — route mounting |
| `apps/api/src/test/mcp.test.ts` | Cross-cutting dispatch tests — domain tests go in `test/<domain>.test.ts` |

**Domain → file ownership** — one agent per row, no overlap:

| Domain | Service | Schema | Routes | MCP | Tests |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|-----|-------|
| issues | `services/issues.ts` | `schemas/issues.ts` | `routes/issues.ts` | `mcp/issues.ts` | `test/issues.test.ts` |
| projects | `services/projects.ts` | `schemas/projects.ts` | `routes/projects.ts` | `mcp/projects.ts` | `test/projects.test.ts` |
| wiki | `services/wiki.ts` | `schemas/wiki.ts` | `routes/wiki.ts` | `mcp/wiki.ts` | `test/wiki.test.ts` |
| files | `services/files.ts` | `schemas/files.ts` | `routes/files.ts` | `mcp/files.ts` | `test/files.test.ts` |
| sprints | `services/sprints.ts` | `schemas/sprints.ts` | `routes/sprints.ts` | `mcp/sprints.ts` | `test/sprints.test.ts` |
| comments | `services/comments.ts` | `schemas/comments.ts` | `routes/comments.ts` | `mcp/comments.ts` | `test/comments.test.ts` |
| task-types | `services/task-types.ts` | `schemas/task-types.ts` | `routes/task-types.ts` | `mcp/task-types.ts` | `test/task-types.test.ts` |
| custom-fields | `services/custom-fields.ts` | `schemas/custom-fields.ts` | `routes/custom-fields.ts` | `mcp/custom-fields.ts` | `test/custom-fields.test.ts` |
| workflow | `services/workflow.ts` | — (no input) | `routes/workflow.ts` | `mcp/workflow.ts` | `test/workflow.test.ts` |
| flow-metrics | `services/flow-metrics.ts` | `schemas/flow-metrics.ts` | `routes/flow-metrics.ts` | `mcp/flow-metrics.ts` | `test/flow-metrics.test.ts` |
| groups | `services/groups.ts` | `schemas/groups.ts` | `routes/groups.ts` | `mcp/groups.ts` | `test/groups.test.ts` |

Frontend islands are **not** domain-locked in the same way, but two agents must never
own the same island file. Assign each island to exactly one agent per batch.

**Deploy:** tag a release (`git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags`) — `release.yml`
builds the artifact and the config-only deploy repo (`projektor-deploy-example`) picks
it up. See the [deploy guide](https://tajd.github.io/projektor/guides/deploying/).

**CI commands** (must all pass before opening a PR):
```bash
bun run gen:docs   # must produce no diff
bun run lint
bun x turbo type-check
bun run --filter @projektor/db test
bun run --filter @projektor/api test:coverage
bun run --filter @projektor/web test:coverage
bun run --filter @projektor/web build
bun run --filter @projektor/docs build
```

**Merge ordering rule:** if two agents both touch the same frontend file (e.g.
`IssueList.tsx`), assign one as "primary" and one as "secondary". Primary merges
first; secondary rebases onto main before merging. Document this in the spawn prompts
and in the fleet manifest.

## Fork differences

This repository is the [`totto2727-org/projektor` fork](https://github.com/totto2727-org/projektor) of [`TAJD/projektor`](https://github.com/TAJD/projektor).
Comparison revision: upstream [`ab122cbea1bae7efce8abe2345ce07375b9dcd13`](https://github.com/TAJD/projektor/commit/ab122cbea1bae7efce8abe2345ce07375b9dcd13), the common ancestor of the fork and upstream `main`.

- `apps/web/src/islands/ProjectList.tsx` and its tests select a writable workspace before project creation.
  The UI hides creation for read-only users, requires selection when several workspaces allow creation, and sends the selected workspace in the POST header.
  This changes the frontend creation flow, not the upstream API or authorization rules.
- Workspace npm dependencies use compatible caret ranges instead of exact dependency versions.
  Bun `1.3.13` is the sole package manager, with `bun.lock` preserving concrete resolutions and root `workspaces` retaining the eight existing packages.
  `bunfig.toml` uses `minimumReleaseAge = 86400`, preserving the existing 24-hour safety window.
  Root `trustedDependencies` retains the reviewed esbuild, lefthook, sharp and workerd lifecycle policy.
  CI, release scripts, hooks and contributor commands use Bun. Node remains the runtime for Node-based tools.
  Historical test fixtures can mention other package managers without introducing executable package-manager entry points.
  No release-age exclusions, dependency overrides or resolutions are configured.
  Runtime and development dependencies are updated to their newest installable compatible releases.
  Vitest remains on the newest compatible 4.1 release because the Workers test pool requires `vitest`, `@vitest/runner` and `@vitest/snapshot` at `^4.1.0`.
  `apps/web/tsconfig.json` excludes generated `dist` bundles from Astro type checks, avoiding out-of-memory analysis after a build.
  The dependency update does not change upstream runtime source or deployment configuration.

Keep this maintained summary here to comply with the repository's root-document policy.
No deployment resources, credentials or release-artifact versions change.

## MCP tool catalog

All tools are available via `POST /mcp/<workspaceId>` (JSON-RPC 2.0). Connect with:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  projektor https://<host>/mcp/<workspaceId>
```

**The full tool list is generated from source — do not hand-maintain a copy here.**
See the **[MCP tool catalog](https://tajd.github.io/projektor/agents/tool-catalog/)**
(generated into `apps/docs/src/content/docs/agents/tool-catalog.md` by
`apps/api/scripts/gen-mcp-catalog.ts` from `apps/api/src/mcp/*.ts`; CI fails if it is
stale). The grouping there separates **Coordination** tools (the agent-native primitives
used by the fleet protocol above) from **Project data** tools.

**Tip:** `get_issue` accepts `ref: "PROJ-42"` (project key + number) — you don't need the UUID when you have the display key.

**`tools/list` caching:** the response carries `ttlMs`/`cacheScope` hints (SEP-2549); `cacheScope` is `"private"` because the list varies per query string (`?domains=`, PROJ-716). These are advisory only — projektor has no server-side cache backing them — so a client that caches `tools/list` must key on the full request URL (path + query), not the path alone, or it will serve one caller's filtered catalog to another.
