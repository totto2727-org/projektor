/**
 * PROJ-894: resolve the agent session a call acts as.
 *
 * An explicit `agentId` always wins. Without one, the credential the call authenticated
 * with (ctx.auth.credentialId, recorded on the session by register_agent) is looked up:
 * exactly one matching session means "that one". Zero or several is a validation error
 * telling the caller to pass agentId. Nothing is held per connection — the answer is
 * derived from the session table on every call, so this stays stateless (PROJ-452).
 *
 * Fleets that share one `pk_` token will normally have several live sessions on it, so
 * for them this always errors and they keep passing agentId — by design.
 *
 * `includeStale`: heartbeat_agent/end_agent may fall back to a session that has just gone
 * stale (that call is what revives it), but only when the credential has no live session;
 * the claim path requires a live one, since a dead session can't hold a lease.
