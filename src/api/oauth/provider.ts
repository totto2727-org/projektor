// PROJ-656/657: the OAuth 2.1 token lifecycle, delegated to Cloudflare's provider.
//
// Why the library at all: it brings PKCE, single-use authorization codes, rotating
// refresh tokens, RFC 7009 revocation, RFC 8707 resource indicators, CIMD client
// registration, and RFC 8252 §7.3 loopback redirect matching — the last of which is
// what makes Claude Code's ephemeral-port callback work. That is the half of OAuth
// that is dangerous to hand-roll. See PROJ-654 for the evidence behind adopting it.
//
// Pinned exactly. The package is pre-1.0 and its surface has moved recently (CIMD,
// resolveExternalToken and ExternalTokenError are all recent additions), so a float
// on the minor is a float on our token security.

// The library's own access tokens are `<userId>:<grantId>:<secret>`. index.ts routes a
// request to the provider only when the bearer has that shape, so every other
// credential projektor accepts — `pk_` API tokens, the Cloudflare Access cookie, the
// dev bypass, the PUBLIC_READ_ONLY viewer — never enters the provider and keeps
// working exactly as before. Without that check, declaring /mcp/ an `apiRoute` would
// 401 every request that arrives without a bearer, silently breaking anonymous
// read-only instances (the live demo) and local dev.

// answers itself; the authorize endpoint it does NOT answer — it passes straight
// through to projektor's consent route — but it must still be routed here, because
// that pass-through is what injects `env.OAUTH_PROVIDER` (the OAuthHelpers the
// consent screen needs to parse the request and complete the grant).

 *
 * Fails open, matching rateLimitMiddleware: a D1 outage is a limiter problem, and
 * turning it into a blanket 500 would break every live connector rather than the
