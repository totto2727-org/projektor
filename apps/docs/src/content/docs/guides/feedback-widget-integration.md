A **feedback source** is a named, independently-credentialed collection point (e.g.
"Onboarding survey", "In-app rating widget") that a project owner or admin creates once.
Any number of sources can exist per project. Each source has its own public submit
token, so you can revoke or rotate one integration without touching another.

## 1. Create a feedback source

Ask an AI agent with MCP access to the workspace to run `create_feedback_source`, or
call the REST endpoint directly:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-projektor-instance/api/projects/<projectId>/feedback-sources \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your workspace API token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "In-app rating widget", "allowedOrigins": ["https://your-site.example"]}'
```

The response includes a one-time `token` — copy it now, it is never shown again. This
token is the trust boundary for the integration: it's deliberately public and safe to
ship in client-side code (the same category as a Sentry DSN or a Stripe publishable
key), narrow in scope (submit-only), and independently revocable/rotatable per source.

`allowedOrigins` is optional and browser-enforced only — a source created with an
explicit origin list only returns a CORS header for a matching `Origin`; the token
still authenticates and inserts feedback from any origin either way. Omit it entirely
for a server-to-server integration where no browser CORS applies.

### Managing a source's lifecycle

Three distinct, independent controls — use the `feedback-sources` REST endpoints or
the equivalent MCP tools (`update_feedback_source`, `rotate_feedback_source_token`,
`revoke_feedback_source`):

- **Pause / resume** (`PATCH .../feedback-sources/:id { isActive: false }`) — a
  reversible kill switch. While paused, submissions to that source's token get a
  `403`. Flip `isActive` back to `true` to resume with the same token. Use this for a
  source you suspect is being spammed or misconfigured and want to stop immediately
  without losing its identity or history.
- **Rotate** (`POST .../feedback-sources/:id/rotate`) — issues a new token and
  invalidates the old one immediately, while keeping the source's `id`, name,
  description, and submission history untouched. Use this if a token leaks.
- **Revoke** (`DELETE .../feedback-sources/:id`) — permanently kills the source.
  History is retained for traceability, but it can never accept another submission;
  create a new source to replace it.

### Abuse controls

`POST /api/feedback/submit` has its own, source-specific defenses, independent of the
authenticated API's rate limits:

- **Dual-keyed rate limiting** — both the source's token and the caller's IP are
  rate-limited independently; either tripping returns `429`.
- **Per-source CORS allow-list** (`allowedOrigins`, above) — a courtesy signal for
  browser embeds, not an access-control gate.
- **The lifecycle controls above** double as abuse levers — pause a source instantly,
  or rotate/revoke its token if it's actually compromised.

Cloudflare Turnstile / bot-check was considered and deferred; not part of this v1.

### Cloudflare Access prerequisite (self-hosted instances)

If your projektor instance sits behind a Cloudflare Zero Trust Access Application at
the edge (the default posture for the whole hostname), `POST /api/feedback/submit`
must be excluded from it — a path-scoped bypass policy, or a separate Access
Application scoped to just this path — before real external/anonymous traffic can
reach the endpoint. This is infrastructure configuration in your deploy setup, not
application code; confirm it's in place before advertising a feedback source as live
to real end users.

## 2. Submit feedback from your site

```ts
/**
 * Minimal, framework-agnostic example: submit end-user feedback from your own
 * product's client code to a projektor feedback source.
 *
 * This file is the single source of truth for the code block in
 * apps/docs/src/content/docs/guides/feedback-widget-integration.md (mirrored
 * in by scripts/gen-feedback-example-page.ts) and is executed against a real
 * projektor instance in apps/api/src/test/feedback-example.test.ts. If either
 * drifts from this file, CI fails — see the "Generated docs are fresh" step.
 */

export interface FeedbackPayload {
	/** -1 or 1 for a "thumbs" ratingScale, or 1-5 for "five_star". */
	rating?: number;
	ratingScale?: "thumbs" | "five_star";
	/** Free-text comment. At least one of rating or body is required. */
	body?: string;
	/** Optional label for who submitted this (e.g. an email or username). */
	submitterLabel?: string;
	/** Optional context URL — e.g. the page or generated-content URL this feedback is about. */
	sourceUrl?: string;
	appVersion?: string;
}

/**
 * POSTs to a projektor feedback source's public submit endpoint.
 *
 * `token` is the public submit token minted for a feedback source (via the
 * create_feedback_source MCP tool or the feedback-sources REST API) — it is
 * meant to be embedded in client-side code, the same trust category as a
 * Sentry DSN or a Stripe publishable key.
 */
export async function submitFeedback(
	endpoint: string,
	token: string,
	feedback: FeedbackPayload
): Promise<{ id: string }> {
	const res = await fetch(endpoint, {
		method: "POST",
		headers: {
			Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
			"Content-Type": "application/json",
		},
		body: JSON.stringify(feedback),
	});
	if (!res.ok) {
		throw new Error(`Feedback submit failed: ${res.status} ${await res.text()}`);
	}
	return res.json();
}
```

Call it after whatever moment makes sense for your product — a thumbs up/down after
generating something, a rating prompt after a task completes, an in-app "send feedback"
form:

```ts
await submitFeedback("https://your-projektor-instance/api/feedback/submit", token, {
  rating: 1,
  ratingScale: "thumbs",
  sourceUrl: window.location.href,
});
```

`rating` and `body` are both optional, but at least one is required per submission.
`ratingScale` is required whenever `rating` is present ("thumbs": -1 or 1; "five_star":
1-5).

## 3. Triage feedback

Submitted feedback shows up on the project's Feedback page
(`/feedback/?projectId=<projectId>`), where workspace owners/admins can filter it by
status/source, mark it reviewed (individually or via multi-select bulk actions), or
convert it directly into an issue. A submission's `sourceUrl` query-string params (if
any) render as an expandable context panel — useful for passing app-specific state
(e.g. which generated content the feedback is about) without projektor needing to
know what the params mean.

The same read/triage actions (`list_feedback`, `update_feedback_status`,
`convert_feedback_to_issue`) are also available as MCP tools, so an agent can triage
conversationally instead of using the web UI. Their bulk equivalents are REST-only for
now (`POST .../feedback/bulk-mark-reviewed`, `POST .../feedback/bulk-convert-to-issue`);
use those endpoints or the web UI for bulk triage. Feedback source *management*
(create/list/update/rotate/revoke, used above) already has full MCP parity too.
